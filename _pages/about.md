I’m Ashraf, a researcher passionate about solving real-world problems through AI. With an undergraduate degree in *[Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.ruet.ac.bd/)* from Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology *[(RUET)](https://www.ruet.ac.bd/)*, my research work spans *[Computer Vision](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/BanglaOngko), [Medical Imaging](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEICT62016.2024.10534436),* and *[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/KD-UDA)*.
<!--I've developed advanced frameworks for medical image segmentation and classification and worked with SOTA models to enhance AI applications.-->

**A Glimpse into My Projects :** My diverse projects range from optimizing neural networks for healthcare to addressing OCR challenges with complex scripts like Bengali. Notable projects include *[Real-time Cycle Thief Detection](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/cycle_theif)* using YOLOv5 and DeepSORT and unsupervised medical image segmentation with *[knowledge distillation](https://github.com/ashraf-ul-alam-amit/KD-UDA)*. Currently, I’m exploring *Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models*, finding them both fascinating and full of potential.
